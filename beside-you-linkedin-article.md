# The App I Built That I Hope You Never Need

You know at least one person affected by cancer. Statistically, you know several. One in two Australians will be diagnosed by the age of 85. That's not a number from a pamphlet — that's your mum, your colleague, your best mate's wife, your neighbour who always waves from across the street.

When someone you care about hears those words, something strange happens to the people around them. Everyone wants to help. Almost nobody knows how.

And the person at the centre of it? They're drowning in information they didn't ask for, terminology they've never heard, appointments they can barely keep track of, and a medical system that — for all its brilliance — wasn't designed around the experience of being terrified.

## The gap nobody talks about

Here's what I noticed: there are extraordinary cancer treatment systems, wonderful support organisations, and deeply compassionate medical professionals. But between the appointment where you hear the diagnosis and the appointment where treatment begins, there's a gap. It's the gap where you sit in a car park trying to remember what the doctor said. Where you Google a word and wish you hadn't. Where your partner asks "what did they say about the medication?" and you realise you can't remember.

It's the gap where questions occur to you at 2am and disappear by morning. Where three different family members are helping but nobody knows what the others have done. Where someone asks "how are you feeling?" and you say "fine" because explaining would take more energy than you have.

That gap isn't a medical problem. It's an organisational one. And it's solvable.

## So I built something

**BesideYou** is a free, open-source companion for the cancer journey. It runs entirely in your browser. No accounts, no sign-up, no data collection, no server. We literally cannot see your data — and I mean that architecturally, not as a privacy promise. There is no server to send it to.

It does a few things quietly and well:

**For patients**, it keeps symptoms, medications, appointments, and questions for the doctor in one calm, private place. It has a medical glossary that translates frightening words into plain language. It has a "Good Days Jar" — a place to capture small moments of light so you can revisit them when things feel dark. And it has breathing exercises for the moments when everything feels like too much.

**For carers**, it has something I haven't seen anywhere else: a **Carer Handoff**. When you're sharing caring duties — and most families do — the hardest part isn't the medical care. It's the handoff between tired humans. "Did she take her 6pm medication?" "Has anyone mentioned the scan results?" "She's anxious about tomorrow — don't bring it up until after lunch." BesideYou lets you write a shift briefing for the next carer, copy it, send it. Simple. Human. Essential.

## What it's not

It's not medical advice. It doesn't diagnose or recommend. It doesn't replace your care team, your GP, or your oncologist. It doesn't connect to wearables, it doesn't use AI to predict anything, and it doesn't gamify your cancer journey — because cancer is not a game.

It's a notebook. A companion. A place to put things so they don't fall through the cracks when you're exhausted, frightened, or both.

## Why open source matters here

I built BesideYou in Australia, so it has Australian crisis numbers and resources. But cancer doesn't respect borders.

The entire codebase is four files. No framework. No build tools. No npm install. Someone in New Zealand, India, the UK, or anywhere else can fork the repository, change the crisis numbers and resources in one file, enable GitHub Pages, and have a localised version live within an hour. For free. Forever.

That's the point. This isn't a product. It's a gift. And the best version of it is the one your community builds for itself.

## The uncomfortable truth

I hope you never need this app. I hope the people you love never need it either.

But if they do — and the statistics suggest some of them will — I wanted something to exist that was free, private, gentle, and genuinely useful. Not another app trying to monetise vulnerability. Not another platform collecting data from people at their most exposed. Just a quiet, reliable companion that asks nothing of you except what you're willing to give.

**BesideYou is live now at [almost-magic.github.io/beside-you](https://almost-magic.github.io/beside-you)**

The source code is on [GitHub](https://github.com/Almost-Magic/beside-you). Fork it, translate it, improve it, share it with someone who needs it.

If you know someone going through cancer right now, send them this link. Not with advice. Not with "you should try this app." Just with: "I saw this and thought of you."

That's enough.
